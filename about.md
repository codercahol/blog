I am a first year graduate student in biophysics. I am fascinated by eco-evolutionary dynamics, phenotypic plasticity, cellular sensing, and many other things that I hope to touch upon as I begin documenting my thoughts. I graduated in March 2020 from the University of Chicago. During my time there I worked with the [Gilbert](https://gilbertlab.com/) (now at UCSD) and [Murugan](http://muruganlab.uchicago.edu/) labs.

I've tremendously enjoyed reading other people's research blogs, so this blog is my effort to contribute to the rich community of science-bloggers and share what I'm thinking about and what doing science looks and feels like to me.
